	  There seems to be something wrong. From my experience
	  iptables/xtables, etc are required and used all over
	  the place. But not in this image. Maybe they are in the
	  ARM side? I am using as an internal modem anyway so I
	  removed them.

	  If instead you want to include the package say yes here.

	  Most people should answer N.
