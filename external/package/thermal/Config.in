	  Kernel module and tools that monitor the temperature of
	  the CPU. They are referenced in a few executables but 
	  don't seem to be executed. If this package isn't included
	  then scripts are linked that log attepted access to the
	  utilities. I have removed them by default.

	  If instead you want to include the package say yes here.

	  Most people should answer N.
