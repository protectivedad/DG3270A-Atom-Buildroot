config BR2_PACKAGE_SC_USB_TOOLS
	bool "ScUsbTools"
	default n
	help
	  Set of tools that seem to communicate through the USB.
	  They include and old SMB1, bftpd and dlna applications.
	  Can't see a need for them so I removed them.

	  If instead you want to include the package say yes here.

	  Most people should answer N.
